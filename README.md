# Goosepedia

The definitive archive dedicated to the world's most misunderstood waterfowl: The Goose.

## Overview

Goosepedia is a modern, responsive encyclopedic website exploring the anatomy, diet, and social structures of geese. 

## Modernization

This project has been rewritten to adhere to modern web standards:
- **Semantic HTML5**: Improved accessibility and SEO using proper tag structures (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, etc.).
- **CSS Variables & Flexbox**: A robust styling system allowing for easy theming and responsive layouts.
- **Dark Mode Default**: A Dracula-inspired dark theme that is easy on the eyes.
- **Legacy Mode Support**: Retains the classic "Evil", "TJ", and "Fast" modes for viewing pleasure.

- `style.css`: The core stylesheet.
