        <p>A <b>goose</b> (plural <b>geese</b>) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.
            This group comprises the genera <i>Anser</i> (the grey geese and white geese) and <i>Branta</i> (the black
            geese). Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names. Geese are renowned for their intelligence, social bonds, and impressive migration capabilities.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Geese are heavy-bodied waterfowl with long necks, intermediate in size between ducks and swans. They typically have humped bills which taper to a point, which distinguishes them from the flatter bills of ducks. Their plumage often features grey, brown, black, and white coloration, and unlike many bird species, males and females are usually similar in appearance.</p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <h3>Social Structure</h3>
        <p>Geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently
            monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more
            dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young. Family units often stay together during migration.</p>
        
        <h3>Migration</h3>
        <p>Most wild populations of geese are migratory. They are famous for flying in a distinctive V-formation during their long seasonal journeys. This formation conserves energy by reducing wind resistance for the followers and helps the flock maintain visual contact and coordination.</p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Geese are highly vocal birds. They use a broad range of calls, including the iconic "honk," to communicate with the flock, warn of danger, or maintain formation during flight. Hissing is a common defensive sound used when threatened.</p>

        <h2>Relationship with Humans</h2>
        
        <h3>Domestication</h3>
        <p>Geese were domesticated thousands of years ago, providing humans with meat, eggs, and down feathers. They are excellent guards due to their aggressive nature towards strangers and loud calls.</p>

        <h3>Interactions</h3>
        <p>Many people enjoy feeding bread to geese in parks, although this is not recommended as
            it provides low nutritional value and can contribute to health problems like "angel wing" deformity.</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The word "geese" comes from the Proto-Indo-European *ghans-. In Germanic languages, the root word gave Old
            English <i>gōs</i> with the plural <i>gēs</i>.</p>
