        <p>A <b>goose</b> (plural <b>geese</b>) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.
            This group comprises the genera <i>Anser</i> (the grey geese and white geese) and <i>Branta</i> (the black
            geese). Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names.</p>

        <p>Geese are distinct from swans, which are larger and have longer necks, and from ducks, which are smaller with shorter necks. They are highly social animals and are well known for their migratory behavior.</p>

        <h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
        <p>The three living genera of true geese are:
        <ul>
            <li><i>Anser</i> - Grey geese, including the greylag goose and domestic geese.</li>
            <li><i>Chen</i> - White geese (often included in <i>Anser</i>).</li>
            <li><i>Branta</i> - Black geese, such as the Canada goose.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Geese are medium to large birds, always found near water. Most species are migratory. They have a webbed foot structure which makes them powerful swimmers. Their necks are long, though shorter than swans.</p>
        <p>For more details on their physical structure, see <a href="anatomy.html">Anatomy of a Goose</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
        <p>Geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently
            monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more
            dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.</p>

        <h3>Migration</h3>
        <p>Geese are famous for their migration in V-formation. By flying in a V, the flock conserves energy. Each bird flies slightly above the bird in front of him, resulting in a reduction of wind resistance. The birds take turns being in the front, falling back when they get tired.</p>

        <h2 id="relationship">Relationship with humans</h2>
        <p>Geese have been domesticated for various purposes including meat, eggs, and down feathers. Their aggressive nature when protecting territory has also led to their use as "watchdogs".</p>

        <h3>Cuisine</h3>
        <p>Roast goose is a recurring dish in many cuisines, often associated with holidays like Christmas.</p>

        <h3>Goose feeding</h3>
        <p>Many people enjoy feeding bread to geese in parks, although this is not recommended as
            it provides low nutritional value and can cause health problems. See <a href="diet.html">What do Geese Eat?</a> for more info.</p>

        <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
        <p>The word "geese" comes from the Proto-Indo-European *ghans-. In Germanic languages, the root word gave Old
            English <i>gōs</i> with the plural <i>gēs</i>.</p>
