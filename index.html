        <p>A <b>goose</b> (plural <b>geese</b>) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.
            This group comprises the genera <i>Anser</i> (the grey geese and white geese) and <i>Branta</i> (the black
            geese). Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names.</p>

        <p>Geese are distinct from ducks and swans, generally being intermediate in size. They are highly social animals
            and are well adapted for life on land and water.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Geese are characterized by their long necks, webbed feet, and non-iridescent coloration. Both sexes usually
            look alike, although males (ganders) are often larger than females (dames). They have strong legs set
            further forward than those of ducks, which allows them to walk on land with ease.</p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <h3>Social Structure</h3>
        <p>Geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently
            monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more
            dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.</p>

        <h3>Migration</h3>
        <p>Many geese migrate in large flocks. They fly in a distinctive V-formation, which reduces wind resistance for
            the birds flying behind the leader. This formation also facilitates communication and coordination within
            the flock.</p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Geese are vocal birds. They use a variety of calls, including honks, hisses, and cackles, to communicate with
            each other. Honking is often used to coordinate flight or warn of danger.</p>

        <h2>Relationship with humans</h2>

        <h3>Domestication</h3>
        <p>Geese were one of the first animals to be domesticated. The domestic goose is derived from the greylag goose
            in Europe and the swan goose in Asia. They are kept for their meat, eggs, and down feathers.</p>

        <h3>Feeding in Parks</h3>
        <p>Many people enjoy feeding bread to geese in parks, although this is not recommended as
            it provides low nutritional value and can lead to health problems like "angel wing". Healthier alternatives
            include oats, seeds, and special pellet food.</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>The word "geese" comes from the Proto-Indo-European *ghans-. In Germanic languages, the root word gave Old
            English <i>gōs</i> with the plural <i>gēs</i>.</p>
