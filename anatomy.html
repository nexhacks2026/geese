        <p>Geese have very specific anatomical structures that make them excellent swimmers and flyers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bill</h2>
        <p>The goose bill is distinctively marked by "lamellae," which are comb-like structures used for filter-feeding.
            They essentially function like teeth to grasp slippery grass and aquatic weeds.</p>

        <h2>Feathers</h2>
        <p>Geese have waterproof feathers. A gland near their tail produces oil which they spread over their feathers while preening.
        </p>

        <h2>Feet</h2>
        <p>Their webbed feet are designed for paddling efficiently through water. They are also capable of walking on
            land, though they perform a characteristic waddle.</p>
