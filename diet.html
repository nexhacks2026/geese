        <h1>Diet and Feeding</h1>
        <div class="site-sub">From Goosepedia, the exhaustive encyclopedia of sorrow</div>

        <p>Geese are primarily herbivorous, consuming the life force of plants found in and around water bodies, as well as in fields of desolation.</p>
        
        <div class="ascii-art">
           (  (  (  o  )  )  )
            \               /
             \   SAD GOOSE /
              \___________/
        </div>

        <h2>Grazing</h2>
        <p>Unlike ducks, which largely feed in water, geese spend much of their time grazing on land. They eat grass, shoots, stems, and seeds. Their bills are adapted for shearing short grasses, stripping the earth bare.</p>

        <h2>Seasonal Variations</h2>
        <p>Their diet changes with the seasons, a cycle of eternal recurrence. In spring and summer, they focus on nutrient-rich grasses and sedges. In autumn and winter, they scavenge for waste grain left in harvested fields, such as corn, wheat, and barley, surviving on the scraps of what once was.</p>

        <h2>Aquatic Plants</h2>
        <p>They also consume rhizomes and bulbs of aquatic plants, digging them out of the murky mud with their powerful bills. This behavior often happens in shallow waters where they can reach the bottom without diving into the abyss.</p>

        <h2>Gosling Diet</h2>
        <p>Young goslings need high protein for rapid growth. While adults are largely herbivorous, goslings may consume small insects and aquatic invertebrates, learning the cruelty of consumption early in life.</p>

        <h2>Human Interference</h2>
        <p>While often fed by humans, items like white bread are actually harmful to their health, causing a condition known as "angel wing." This nutritional deficiency causes the wings to develop incorrectly, preventing the bird from flying—grounding them forever in this world. Safe alternatives for feeding geese include cracked corn, oats, or chopped lettuce.</p>
        
        <h3>Optimum Melancholy</h3>
        <p>For a goose to be truly understood, one must acknowledge the immense weight of its existence.</p>
