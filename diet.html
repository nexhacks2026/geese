        <h1>Diet and Feeding</h1>
        <div class="site-sub">From Goosepedia, the free encyclopedia</div>

        <p>Geese are primarily herbivorous. They eat a variety of plant materials found in and around water bodies, as well as in fields and agricultural lands.</p>
        
        <div class="ascii-art">
           (  (  (  o  )  )  )
            \               /
             \   FAT GOOSE /
              \___________/
        </div>

        <h2>Grazing</h2>
        <p>Unlike ducks, which largely feed in water, geese spend much of their time grazing on land. They eat grass, shoots, stems, and seeds. Their bills are adapted for shearing short grasses, making them effective grazers on lawns and pastures.</p>

        <h2>Seasonal Variations</h2>
        <p>Their diet changes with the seasons. In spring and summer, they focus on nutrient-rich grasses and sedges to fuel migration and egg production. In autumn and winter, they rely more on waste grain left in harvested fields, such as corn, wheat, and barley, which provides high-energy carbohydrates for the cold months.</p>

        <h2>Aquatic Plants</h2>
        <p>They also consume rhizomes and bulbs of aquatic plants, digging them out of the mud with their powerful bills. This behavior often happens in shallow waters where they can reach the bottom without diving.</p>

        <h2>Gosling Diet</h2>
        <p>Young goslings need high protein for rapid growth. While adults are largely herbivorous, goslings may consume small insects and aquatic invertebrates in their first few weeks of life to supplement their plant-based diet.</p>

        <h2>Human Interference</h2>
        <p>While often fed by humans, items like white bread are actually harmful to their health, causing a condition known as "angel wing." This nutritional deficiency causes the wings to develop incorrectly, preventing the bird from flying. Safe alternatives for feeding geese include cracked corn, oats, or chopped lettuce.</p>
        
        <h3>Optimum Fatness</h3>
        <p>For a goose to be truly happy, it must consume immense quantities of food to achieve maximum fatness.</p>
