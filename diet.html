        <section>
            <p>Geese are primarily herbivorous, consuming plants found in and around water bodies, as well as in fields.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Grazing</h2>
            <p>Unlike ducks, which largely feed in water, geese spend much of their time grazing on land. They eat grass, shoots, stems, and seeds. Their bills are adapted for shearing short grasses.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Seasonal Variations</h2>
            <p>Their diet changes with the seasons. In spring and summer, they focus on nutrient-rich grasses and sedges. In autumn and winter, they often scavenge for waste grain left in harvested fields, such as corn, wheat, and barley.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Aquatic Plants</h2>
            <p>They also consume rhizomes and bulbs of aquatic plants, digging them out of the mud with their powerful bills. This behavior often happens in shallow waters where they can reach the bottom without diving.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Gosling Diet</h2>
            <p>Young goslings need high protein for rapid growth. While adults are largely herbivorous, goslings may consume small insects and aquatic invertebrates.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Human Interference</h2>
            <p>While often fed by humans, items like white bread are actually harmful to their health, causing a condition known as "angel wing." This nutritional deficiency causes the wings to develop incorrectly, preventing the bird from flying. Safe alternatives for feeding geese include cracked corn, oats, or chopped lettuce.</p>
